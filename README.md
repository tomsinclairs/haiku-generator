# haiku-generator
Haskell project for university assignment for subject Functional Programming.

I wrote Proj2.hs. The program has 2 functions:
 - **fillInPoem** takes a wordlist and a list of number of syllables, and creates all poems with words drawn from the wordlist where the number of syllables of the words in the poem exactly matches the value in the number-of-syllables list, in the order of that list. Every word in the poem be distinct.
 - **generateAllHaikus** generates all haikus, given a wordlist from which all words in the poem must be drawn.
